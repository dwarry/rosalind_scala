# rosalind_scala
[Project Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/) problems implemented in Scala. 

Entry point is `uk.org.warry.rosalind.RosalindApp` which takes the following arguments:
* the code of the problem
* One or more data values. If there is too much to pass directly on the command line, you can specify a file url

Output, in the format specified by the problem, is just dumped to stdout.
